This school project aims to create a real-time, text-based chat platform that allows users to engage in conversations within various chat rooms. Built using technologies like GraphQL, Node.js, and a NoSQL database. Chat rooms will be created by site itself and users can change rooms with site navigation. Idea is that you will be randomised into next room with other user.

## Focus groups:

The target audience for this application is students, ranging from teenagers to adults who are looking to engage in conversations on diverse topics. Whether it's a casual chat, intellectual discourse, or hobby-based conversation, our platform aims to cater to various interests and demographics. Given its user-friendly design, the application is suitable for both tech-savvy individuals and those new to online chat platforms.

## How to run tests:

To run tests you will need to have admin profile manually added to your databases users collection like this:

{
username: "admin",
email: "admin@test.fi",
password: "admin"
}

Also every other collection should be empty before tests are ran.
